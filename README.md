Problems1.    Find   the   residue   of the   function   z3ez/1 at z = 0 and show that it has no anti-derivative on the punctured complex   plane   C \ {0}.

Find   the   Laurent   series   of z2 - 3z + 2/1   valid   in   following   the   regions   respectively:                    (20 = 10 + 10 marks)A1   =   {z   ∈ C   | 0   <   |z   − 1| <   1}             and               A2    =   {z   ∈   C   |   1   <   |z|   <   2}.3.      Locate   the   singularities   off f(z) = ez + 1/(z2 + π2)2   and   determine   their   types.   If a   singularity   is   a   pole,   ﬁnd   its   order.                       (16   marks)

(a)    State   Liouville’s   theorem.
      Show   that   the   function   g(z) = z/sinz,   is   not   bounded   on   C \ {0}.5.      Let   f (z) = z4 + 2/z2.

(a)    Let   R   >   0   is   a   real   number.    Sketch   the   contour   C   =   L + γR   ,   where   γR   (t)   =   Reit   ,   0   ≤ t   ≤ π   ,   and L(t)   = t,   −R   ≤ t   ≤ R.
(b)    Show   that γR   f   (z)dz   → 0   if   R   →   ∞   .
(c)    Assume   that   R > 2.    Calculate C   f   (z)dz.    (Hint:    Use   Cauchy’s   residue   theorem.)
      Using   the   results   obtained   in (a)-(c),   evaluate   the   improper   integral    x4 + 2/x2dx.
Total   mark:    100   marks   =   Problems   (90   marks)   +   Clarity   of computations   and   mathematical   reasoning,   as   well   as   neatness   of overall   presentation   (10   marks).
